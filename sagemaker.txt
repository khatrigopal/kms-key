sagemaker endpoint monitoring metrics in cloudwatch


Amazon SageMaker endpoints can be monitored using Amazon CloudWatch, which provides a range of metrics to help you monitor the health and performance of your endpoints. These metrics can be used to detect and diagnose issues with your endpoints, as well as to track their performance over time.

Here are some of the endpoint monitoring metrics available in CloudWatch:

Invocations: This metric tracks the number of times the endpoint has been invoked over a specified time period.

Errors: This metric tracks the number of errors that occur during endpoint invocations.

Latency: This metric tracks the time it takes for an endpoint to process a request, from the time the request is received until a response is sent.

CPU and memory utilization: These metrics track the percentage of CPU and memory usage by the endpoint during processing.

Throttling: This metric tracks the number of requests that are rejected due to throttling, which occurs when the endpoint is unable to handle the volume of incoming requests.

HTTP status codes: This metric tracks the distribution of HTTP status codes returned by the endpoint, such as 200 for successful requests or 404 for not found.

You can view these metrics in the CloudWatch console or programmatically using the CloudWatch APIs. You can also set up CloudWatch alarms to notify you if any of these
