sagemaker endpoint monitoring metrics in cloudwatch


Amazon SageMaker endpoints can be monitored using Amazon CloudWatch, which provides a range of metrics to help you monitor the health and performance of your endpoints. These metrics can be used to detect and diagnose issues with your endpoints, as well as to track their performance over time.

Here are some of the endpoint monitoring metrics available in CloudWatch:

Invocations: This metric tracks the number of times the endpoint has been invoked over a specified time period.

Errors: This metric tracks the number of errors that occur during endpoint invocations.

Latency: This metric tracks the time it takes for an endpoint to process a request, from the time the request is received until a response is sent.

CPU and memory utilization: These metrics track the percentage of CPU and memory usage by the endpoint during processing.

Throttling: This metric tracks the number of requests that are rejected due to throttling, which occurs when the endpoint is unable to handle the volume of incoming requests.

HTTP status codes: This metric tracks the distribution of HTTP status codes returned by the endpoint, such as 200 for successful requests or 404 for not found.

You can view these metrics in the CloudWatch console or programmatically using the CloudWatch APIs. You can also set up CloudWatch alarms to notify you if any of these

how to create aws cloudwatch dashboard for sagemaker endpoint monitoring


To create an AWS CloudWatch dashboard for SageMaker endpoint monitoring, you can follow these steps:

Open the CloudWatch console in the AWS Management Console.
Click on the "Dashboards" link in the left navigation menu, and then click on the "Create Dashboard" button.
Give your dashboard a name and click on the "Create Dashboard" button.
On the dashboard page, click on the "Add widget" button to add a widget to the dashboard.
Select the "SageMaker Endpoint Metrics" option from the widget gallery.
Select the appropriate SageMaker endpoint from the dropdown list, and choose the metric you want to monitor (such as "Invocations" or "Errors").
Customize the widget settings as needed, such as the time range, statistic type, and visualization type.

Amazon SageMaker endpoint monitoring allows you to track the performance of your model endpoint in real-time and detect anomalies or deviations from the expected behavior. Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service that provides metrics and logs for AWS resources and applications. You can use CloudWatch to monitor your SageMaker endpoints and set up alarms to notify you when certain metrics reach a specified threshold.

To set up endpoint monitoring with CloudWatch, you can follow these steps:

Create a monitoring schedule: In the Amazon SageMaker console, create a monitoring schedule for your endpoint. This schedule specifies the data capture and analysis configuration for the endpoint, including the frequency of monitoring, the data capture method, and the monitoring image to use.

Enable monitoring: After you create a monitoring schedule, enable monitoring for the endpoint. This allows SageMaker to capture the required data and send it to CloudWatch.

Create a CloudWatch dashboard: In the CloudWatch console, create a dashboard to visualize the metrics and logs from your endpoint. You can use the SageMaker-provided dashboard template or create your own custom dashboard.

Set up alarms: Set up alarms in CloudWatch to notify you when metrics from your endpoint reach a specified threshold. For example, you can set up an alarm to notify you when the endpoint's error rate exceeds a certain percentage.

With these steps, you can monitor your SageMaker endpoint using CloudWatch and take proactive measures to maintain its performance and availability.
